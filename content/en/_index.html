        <p>We want the degrowth movement to be colourful, creative, artistic, playful, experimental, embodied... through arts! Degrowth gives us a hard truth, economic growth cannot continue being our only and common pursuit, this is because it needs infinite resource extraction and social injustices to continue. But degrowth needs to move beyond the academic sphere into our communities by holding creative spaces of artistic co-creation!</p>

        <p>The arts can mobilise for socio-ecological change. They transmit more than we can rationally grasp: our emotions, our rage, our fears, our hopes, and what we fight for. Let our artistic practices be the life-juice of the degrowth movement! In the art residency, we focus on co-creating degrowth-based art practices. We want to invent, embody and inhabit them together. The art residency allows us to create a community around collaborative artistic processes for further action, exchanging and creating tools for art based degrowth practices.</p>
