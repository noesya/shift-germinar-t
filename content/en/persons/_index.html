        <p>Carlo is an actor and director, Lara an artivist researcher and Vlio a visual artist. The three of them studied degrowth in Barcelona and dedicate themselves to create spaces at the intersection of degrowth and art and activism. Over the past two years they have hosted two editions of Germinar-t art residencies in Sunseed and presented their reflections at the Degrowth conference in Zagreb 2023.</p>
